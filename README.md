# CSN Research Project

Cities and urban systems are intricate networks of streets and paths forming the backbone of human interaction and travel behaviour. By modelling these systems as graphs—where intersections and dead-ends are vertices, and street segments are edges—we can analyse their structural properties to gain insights into **urban design** and **transportation efficiency**.

This project analyses the street networks of Catalonia’s **43 comarques** (including Val d'Aran). Metrics such as **street entropy** are used to classify and compare networks, uncovering differences in urban structure. We also model the distribution of street lengths for the four provincial capitals.

Our research aims to **characterise Catalan street networks** and connect these findings to **urban planning and design concepts**, drawing on established analytical techniques and benchmarks. This analysis provides empirical evidence that may inform both urban science and planning practice.

## Project Folder Structure

The repository is organised as follows:


```
└── data
    └── raw
        └── graphs
└── src
└── notebooks
└── report
├── README.md

```

## How to Run the Project

The project workflow has two main steps:

1. **Characterising Street Networks (Exploratory Analysis) (Python / Jupyter Notebook)**  
   - Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.  
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially.

2. **Street Segment Length Analysis (R Script in `src/`)**  
   - Navigate to the `src/` folder in a terminal or your preferred IDE.  
   - Run the R script.
